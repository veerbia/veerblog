*plain-html-blog* is a very clean [Jekyll][jekyll] blog that works without CSS. It was inspired by websites which (for valid reasons) make minimal use of styling with CSS and the like.

Just to get an idea, check out [stallman.org][stallman], Richard Stallman's personal website, [paulgraham.com][graham] or [motherfuckingwebsite.com][motherfuckingwebsite] (sorry for the language :~). They all come with a certain 90s flavour which in 2016 is still very functional and in a way elegant (only 90s developers will know &hellip; :)

Other than that, this Jekyll blog works like any other static website so you should feel right at home.

So now go ahead, you'll want to [get the source code][source-code-blog] and read the README to learn how make your own *plain-html-blog*.
